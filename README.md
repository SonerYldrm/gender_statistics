# Data analysis on gender and population statistics

At the core of every business, there are people. People create value for people and sell it to people. Therefore, changes on people effect every business. The characteristics of populations and life style of people changed dramatically in the near past. Critical measures that define the population of a country such as fertility rate, death rate, life expectancy, obesity, distribution of labor force occupation have been changing. Business must take these in consideration as people remains crucial for each and every business.

Iâ€™m not a social scientist so I will not try to deeply explore demographic changes. I will try to support changes with data and visualizations. This is more like a data analysis project with a bonus story.

Worldbank.org has comprehensive datasets on social and socio-economic indicators of populations. Data for labor force, fertility and death rates, life expectancy, obesity and population age distributions are available for different countries under gender statistics.
